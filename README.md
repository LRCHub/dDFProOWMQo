[00:29.42] Play by the rules
[00:34.24] But I'd rather do something naughty
[00:39.09] Let's find a room, whoa
[00:43.84] Inside this after party
[00:48.28] Been on a hunt, found what I want
[00:53.04] Found what I want in you
[01:05.04] 
[00:58.44] I found treasure in the hills
[01:03.19] I found treasure in the hills
[01:07.89] I found treasure in the hills
[01:12.55] I found treasure in the hills
[01:27.05] 
[01:17.95] Chase more than diamonds and gold
[01:21.61] I'm trying to find me a soul
[01:27.43] Chase more than diamonds and gold
[01:30.96] I'm trying to find me a soul
[01:44.96] 
[01:35.75] You live alone
[01:40.65] Now it's just you and your shadow
[01:45.30] Let's change that up
[01:50.06] Let's take it into tomorrow
[01:54.60] Been on a hunt, found what I want (been on a hunt)
[01:59.49] Found what I want in you
[02:11.49] 
[02:04.46] I found treasure in the hills
[02:09.28] I found treasure in the hills
[02:14.07] I found treasure in the hills
[02:18.83] I found treasure in the hills
[02:33.33] 
[02:24.12] Chase more than diamonds and gold
[02:27.87] I'm trying to find me a soul (find, find me a soul)
[02:33.66] Chase more than diamonds and gold
[02:37.44] I'm trying to find me a soul (oh)
